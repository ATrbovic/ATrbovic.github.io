        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior at FSU pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Economics. I have always been fascinated by the intersection of these two fields and how they can be leveraged together to create impactful solutions to real-world problems. 
          As a computer science student with an economics background, I have learned how to approach problems from both a technical and business standpoint, which has allowed me to see the big picture and create solutions that are both technically 
          sound and economically feasible. In addition to my love for economics and computer science, I also have a passion for product design. I enjoy learning about the science behind what makes a "good" product, and I am always looking for ways 
          to improve my own design skills. Whether it's through user research, prototyping, or testing, I believe that designing great products requires a deep understanding of the user's needs and preferences, as well as a willingness to iterate and improve upon your work.
          When I am not working on my academic pursuits, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies, such as gaming, traveling, and cooking.
