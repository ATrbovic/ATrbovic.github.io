        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p> I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Florida State University. My research 
          focuses on quantum game theory and its application to strategic optimization problems. Additionally, I explore
          how quantum mechanics can enhance decision-making in complex systems, particularly in nonlocal games.</p>

        <p>I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Economics, so I enjoy developing software that bridges these fields.
          My work spans from developing machine learning models for sports analytics to investigating quantum algorithms for optimization problems in industrial engineering.
          Additionally, I have experience as a software engineering intern, where I contributed to building scalable web applications for financial services.
        </p>

        <p>When I am not focused on my research, I'm reading, playing CounterStrike, or planning my next vacation.</p>

        <h2>Current Research</h2>
        <h3>Quantum Game Theory & Strategic Optimization</h3>
        <p>My doctoral research investigates how quantum entanglement and superposition can provide strategic advantages in competitive scenarios. I'm particularly interested in nonlocal games such as the CHSH game, where quantum strategies can outperform any classical approach.</p>
        
        <p>Using Qiskit and custom quantum simulators, I explore how these quantum mechanical properties might inform strategic thinking in broader contexts, from supply chain optimization to collaborative decision-making in distributed systems.</p>

        <h2>Featured Work</h2>
        <h3>Dynamic Tackler Identification System</h3>
        <p>Developed an AI system using convolutional neural networks to predict the most likely tackler in NFL plays. The system processes real-time player positioning data and achieves significant improvements in tactical analysis accuracy. This work demonstrates the application of deep learning to complex spatial-temporal prediction problems.</p>
        
        <h3>Quantum Chess</h3>
        <p>Quantum Chess is a Python-based chess engine and GUI that integrates quantum mechanics principles into traditional chess. 
          The game allows players to perform quantum moves such as superposition and entanglement, making for a unique 
          and educational chess experience. </p>
