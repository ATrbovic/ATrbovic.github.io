        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Florida State University, exploring the fascinating intersection of quantum computing and strategic optimization. My research focuses on how quantum mechanical properties can enhance decision-making in complex systems, particularly in nonlocal games and quantum game theory.</p>
        
        <p>I enjoy building tools that seamlessly blend rigorous analysis, cutting-edge algorithms, and thoughtful design. My work spans from developing machine learning models for sports analytics to investigating quantum algorithms for optimization problems in industrial engineering.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not immersed in research, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, writing about the latest developments in quantum computing, or collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to tackle complex real-world challenges.</p>

        <h2>Current Research</h2>
        <h3>Quantum Game Theory & Strategic Optimization</h3>
        <p>My doctoral research investigates how quantum entanglement and superposition can provide strategic advantages in competitive scenarios. I'm particularly interested in nonlocal games such as the CHSH game, where quantum strategies can outperform any classical approach.</p>
        
        <p>Using Qiskit and custom quantum simulators, I explore how these quantum mechanical properties might inform strategic thinking in broader contexts, from supply chain optimization to collaborative decision-making in distributed systems.</p>

        <h2>Featured Work</h2>
        <h3>Dynamic Tackler Identification System</h3>
        <p>Developed an AI system using convolutional neural networks to predict the most likely tackler in NFL plays. The system processes real-time player positioning data and achieves significant improvements in tactical analysis accuracy. This work demonstrates the application of deep learning to complex spatial-temporal prediction problems.</p>
        
        <h3>NFL Replay Visualizer</h3>
        <p>Built an interactive C++ application using SFML for analyzing NFL game data. The system integrates with PostgreSQL databases to provide real-time visualization of player movements and strategic formations, reducing analysis runtime by 63%.</p>
